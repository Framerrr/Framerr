# Link Grid

A customizable grid of quick-access links with icons. Add bookmarks to your favorite services, tools, or any URL. Links are managed through the widget's edit mode — click a link in edit mode to add, remove, or edit links, and reorder them through the widget's configuration panel.

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Grid Alignment | Center | Align links within the grid: **Left**, **Center**, or **Right** |
| Link Order | — | Drag-and-drop editor to reorder your links |

:::info No Header
This widget hides the header by default and does not support showing one — it's designed to be a clean, minimal link bar.
