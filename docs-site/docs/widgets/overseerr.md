# Seerr Requests

Displays pending and approved media requests from your Seerr (Overseerr/Jellyseerr) instance. Browse requests with poster art in carousel or stacked list mode.

## Supported Integrations

| Integration | Features |
|-------------|----------|
| [Seerr](/docs/integrations/overseerr) | Pending requests, approved requests, request status |

## Configuration Options

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| View Mode | Auto | **Auto** — adapts to widget size. **Carousel** — horizontal poster scroll. **Stacked** — vertical backdrop list. |

:::tip Works with Sonarr & Radarr
If [Sonarr](/docs/integrations/sonarr) or [Radarr](/docs/integrations/radarr) are also configured in Framerr and share the same servers as Seerr, real-time download progress will appear directly on request cards. No additional configuration is needed — Framerr links the integrations automatically.
