# Widgets

Widgets are the building blocks of your Framerr dashboard. Each widget displays data from one or more [integrations](/docs/integrations), or provides standalone utility features.

## Common Widget Settings

Every widget includes these universal settings in its configuration modal:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Toggle Header** | Show or hide the widget's title bar |
| **Widget Name** | Custom display name for the widget |
| **Flatten UI** | Remove glassmorphism effects for a flat appearance |

## Integration Fallback

Widgets that require an integration automatically bind to the first available one. If that integration is later **removed or disabled**, the widget falls back to the next available integration of the same type.

Fallback only applies when an integration is removed or toggled off — if a bound integration is **temporarily unreachable** (e.g. the server is down), the widget stays bound and shows an error state instead of switching.
